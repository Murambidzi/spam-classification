# README for LSTM-Based Text Processing Repository

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for implementing and understanding Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, particularly focused on applications in text and speech processing. The LSTM's architecture is adept at handling sequential or time-series data, making it highly suitable for a range of tasks including text classification, natural language processing (NLP), and spam detection.

## Contents
1. **LSTM Network Implementation**: Source code for LSTM models designed for text and speech data processing.
2. **Embedding Layer Tutorial**: Detailed examples and explanations of how Embedding layers work within LSTM networks to process text data.
3. **Training and Optimization Scripts**: Scripts to train LSTM models using optimizers like Adam and loss functions appropriate for various tasks, including binary classification.
4. **Documentation**: Extensive documentation on the architecture of LSTM networks and their application in processing sequential data.
5. **Case Studies**: Real-world applications of LSTM networks in text classification, NLP tasks, and more.
6. **Research Papers**: Links to essential research papers providing foundational knowledge and recent advancements in LSTM networks [(Lindemann et al., 2021)](https://consensus.app/papers/survey-memory-networks-time-series-prediction-lindemann/1a38bbd9ab275f538bb3a4db1f348fd8/?utm_source=chatgpt); [(Fischer & Krauss, 2017)](https://consensus.app/papers/learning-memory-networks-market-predictions-fischer/b41811acd90b5298b24503e5d10e2ece/?utm_source=chatgpt); [(Khrulkov et al., 2019)](https://consensus.app/papers/tensorized-embedding-layers-efficient-model-compression-khrulkov/5c823f24636f5c17a190e19383126488/?utm_source=chatgpt); [(Palangi et al., 2015)](https://consensus.app/papers/sentence-embedding-using-long-shortterm-memory-networks-palangi/412ff239075258a1b94681f9a825f3f2/?utm_source=chatgpt).
